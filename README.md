# Movie-Scraping-BeautifulSoup-Requests-exercise

This program uses the requests and **BeautifulSoup** modules to web scrape the *Hollywood Reporter's Top 100 movies* and creates a txt file with the list.

It is a simple, but very useful, exercise to pratice with **requests** and **bs4 BeautifulSoup** for **web scraping** with **Python**.
